<h2>About Us.</h2>

<p>For thousands of years, the Space Black Market website has provided access to hard to find items. Looking for a blaster used to take out countless Storm Troopers? We got it. Looking for Anakins Burnt Legs???? We have that too... <small>weird.</small> Our sellers also offer Ancient Artifacts, Schematics and exotic Ships.</p> 

<p>The Space Black Market was originally a pretty laid back place to do business, everything sold was totally legal. It all went down hill when the Jujubean species invaded solar system where we were located. The Jujubean people brought weapons, stolen artifacts, ships and many other items that were considered dangerous and illegal in many galaxies. They were too powerful, we couldn't stop them from selling their illegal goods. While many want things to go back to normal, many more want things to stay how they are... Turns out, selling illegal goods brings in the big bucks. </p>

<p>So please, have a look around, feel free to purchase something, and please, do <b>NOT</b>, I repeat, <b>DO NOT</b>, mention The Great Tea Spill of 2463 to any of the Jujubean sellers.</p>
