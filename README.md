# SpaceBlackMarket.MVC

I created Space Black Market mainly because I wanted to create something fun and creative. I initially wanted to create an MVC about a movie theater and looking at show times and purchasing tickets but I quickly realized that I wasn't too excited about creating that so I changed the project to something I'm more passionate about... SPACE! 

The Space Black Market is for galactic Space Travelers looking to purchase illegal/dangerous/stolen items posted by other Space Travelers. ST (Space Travelers) can visit this site, knowing they can remain anonymous by using a Traveler Alias when registering. When they create an account, they are granted access to the site, they can purchase/sell items, view information for known Outposts along with viewing previous purchases they have made. 

I utilized ASP.NET Framework, HTML, CSS and minimal JavaScript, although I do plan on implenting more JS when I become more familiar with it. 

I updated Bootstrap 5 at the beginning of the project to utilize Bootswatch and ran into an issue I spent a lot of time on. After about a day of troubleshooting, I was finally about to resolve it by adding a ".min" in my BundleConfig.cs file.

At some point I will add a message board for Space Travelers to visit to post about some of the jobs they went on and things they have stolen.
